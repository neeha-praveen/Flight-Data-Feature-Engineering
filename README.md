# ✈️ Flight Data Feature Engineering

This project focuses exclusively on feature engineering for a flight dataset. The goal is to transform and enrich raw data into structured, informative features that can be used in downstream machine learning tasks or detailed analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

- Extract, clean, and preprocess raw flight data
- Engineer new features such as journey time, total stops, and departure hour
- Convert categorical variables into a machine-learning-friendly format
- Ensure dataset readiness for model training and evaluation

## 🔧 Techniques Applied

- Handling missing values
- Datetime feature extraction (day, month, hour)
- Label encoding and one-hot encoding
- Custom transformation of categorical and textual fields

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Sklearn
